# Git Staging Environmnet

---

## What is the Staging Environment?

The **staging environmnet** (or **stating area**) is like a waiting room fo ryour changes.

You use it to tell Git exactly which files you want to include in your next commit.

This gives you control over what goes into your project history.

Here are some key commands for staging:

- `git add <file>` - Stage a file
- `git add --all or git add -A` - Stage all changes
- `git status` - See what is staged
- `git restore --staged <file>` - Unstage a file

---

## Stage a File with `git add`

To add a file to the staging area, use `git add <file>`:

> Eg:
> git add index.html

Now `index.html` is staged. You can check what is staged with `git status`:

> EG:
>
> ```sh
> git status
> On branch master
>
> No commits yet
>
> Changes to be committed:
>   (use "git restor --staged ..." to unstage)
>       new file: index.html
> ```

---

## Stage Multiple Files (`git add --all`, `git add -A`)

You can stage all changes (new, modified, and deleted files) at once:

> Eg: `git add --all`

`git add -A` does the same thing as `git add --all`.

---

## Check Staged Files with `git status`

See whcih files are staged and ready to commit:

> Eg:
>
> ```sh
> git status
> On branch master
>
> No commits yet
>
> Changes to be committed:
>   (use "git restore --staged ..." to unstage)
>       new file: README.md
>       new file: style.css
>       new file: index.html
> ```

---

## How to Unstage a Fiel

If you staged a file by mistake, you can remove it from the staging area (unstage it) with:

> Eg:
>
> ```sh
> git restore --staged index.html
> ```

Now index.html is no longer staged. You can also use `git reset HEAD index.html` for the same effect.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Staged the wrong file?** Use `git restore --staged <file>` to unstage it.
- **Forgot to stage a file?** Just run `git add <file>` again before you commit.
- **Not sure what's staged?** Run `git status` to see what will be committed.
